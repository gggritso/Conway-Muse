# Conway-Muse

A pretty Conway's Game of Life in JS. The only important additional feature is that you can click any cell to kill/revive it. That's it. You can also pause/play through the module, but you know, whatever :)

Works in Chrome on OS X. I didn't really feel like adding compatibility to the other browsers.
